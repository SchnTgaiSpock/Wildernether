# Wildernether

Wildernether seeks to improve survivability in the nether by adding food and tools that can easily be crafted in the nether

You can find the wiki at [https://github.com/SchnTgaiSpock/Wildernether/wiki](https://github.com/SchnTgaiSpock/Wildernether/wiki)

## Gathering Resources

The main way to gather resources in Wildernether is by breaking nether plants with Scythes. The plants that you can break are Nether Sprouts, Warped Roots, Warped Fungus, Twisting Vines, Crimson Roots, Crimson Fungus, Weeping Vines, and Shroomlight.

### Plants

Wildernether plants are only used in cooking recipes. More uses will be added in the future.

### Secret Plants

Using the Soul Scythe, you have an increased chance to get 5 other secret plants. They have no use other than a collectible.

## Cuisine

Wildernether food can be made in the Enhanced Crafting Table and the Blackstone Stove.

### Cooking in the Blackstone Stove

The Blackstone Stove has four modes: Pot, Frying, Oven, and Brewing. See the [wiki page](https://github.com/SchnTgaiSpock/Wildernether/wiki/Blackstone-Stove) for more details.

### Reading the Stove recipes

The top 6 slots in the Simefun Guide correspond to the 6 slots in the Stove. For soup and brewing recipes, the bottom-middle item goes in the container slot to the left.

## Plans for the Future

I plan on updating and maintaining this addon even after the 2022 AddonJam ends.
