# Wildernether
Wildernether seeks to improve survivability in the nether by adding food and tools that can be easily crafted in the nether

## Gathering Resources
The main way to gather resources in Wildernether is by breaking nether plants with Scythes. The plants that you can break are Nether Sprouts, Warped Roots, Warped Fungus, Twisting Vines, Crimson Roots, Crimson Fungus, Weeping Vines, and Shroomlight.

### Plants
Wildernether plants are only used in cooking recipes. More uses will be added in the future.

### Secret Plants
Using the Soul Scythe, you have an increased chance to get 5 other secret plants. They have no use other than a collectible.

## Cuisine
Wildernether food can be made in the Enhanced Crafting Table and the Blackstone Stove.

### Cooking in the Blackstone Stove
The Blackstone Stove has three modes: Soup, Frying, and Oven. For soup mode, place a Cauldron on top of the Stove. For Frying mode, place a Heavy Weighted Pressure Plate (Iron Pressure Plate) on top of the Stove. Oven mode is the default.

When using the correct mode and recipe, clicking on the "Click to cook!" button in the Stove's menu will put the cooked item in the output slot.

### Reading the Stove recipes
The top 6 slots in the Simefun Guide correspond to the 6 slots in the Stove. For soup recipes, the bottom-middle item goes in the Bowl slot.

## Plans for the Future
I plan on updating and maintaining this addon even after the 2022 AddonJam ends.
