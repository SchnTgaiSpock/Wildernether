# Wildernether
Wildernether seeks to improve survivability in the nether by adding more food and tools that can be easily crafted in the nether

## Gathering Resources
The main method to gether resources in Wildernether is by right-clicking nether plants with hoes. Different tiered hoes have different levels of efficacy, with 
wood being the lowest, and netherrite being the best. Wildernether also adds a Gilded Blackstone Hoe that performs better than diamond, but worse than netherrite.

## Cuisine
Wildernether food can be made in the Enhanced Crafting Table, or in the Nether Pot.
