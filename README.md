# Wildernether
Wildernether seeks to improve survivability in the nether by adding more food and tools that can be easily crafted in the nether

## Gathering Resources
The main method to gether resources in Wildernether is by right-clicking nether plants with hoes. Different tiered hoes have different levels of efficacy, with 
wood being the lowest, and netherrite being the best. Wildernether also adds a Blackstone Scythe that performs better than diamond, but worse than netherrite.

### Secret Plants
Using the Soul Scythe, you have a chance to get 5 other secret plants. They have no use other than a collectible.

## Cuisine
Wildernether food can be made in the Enhanced Crafting Table and the Blackstone Stove.

### Cooking in the Blackstone Stove
The Blackstone Stove has three modes: Soup, Frying, and Oven. For soup mode, place a Cauldron on top of the Stove. For Frying mode, place a Heavy Weighted Pressure Plate (Iron Pressure Plate) on top of the Stove. Oven mode is the default.

When using the correct mode and recipe, clicking on the "Click to cook!" button in the Stove's menu will put the cooked item in the output slot.

### Reading the Stove recipes
The top 6 slots in the Simefun Guide correspond to the 6 slots in the Stove. The middle bottom slot is the item in the bowl slot for soup recipes.
